The implementation of ZWA2 as a standalone application is based on the ZWA2 Bash shell scirpt which you can find here.

For optimum decontamination, we highly recommend downloading and inputting the SILVA_LSU+SSU_rRNA.prinseq-ns_max_p1.fasta.gz file as reference, which comprises of the non-redundant (Ref NR99) datasets of the SILVA database release 138.1 for 16S, 18S, 23S and 28S rRNAs from several _Archaea_, _Bacteria_ and _Eukarya_ organisms, filtered a priori by PRINSEQ-lite v. 0.20.4 in order to remove rRNA entries with more than 1% of ambiguous Nâ€™s and further aid mapping procedures.
