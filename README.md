# ZWA2
ZWA2 is a context-based trimming bioinformatics tool for virus genome RNA-seq read decontamination. The tool dissects chimera reads that arise during NGS, removing ribosomal chimeric moieties derived from the local microbiota of the sample. The clean output reads are then ready to be fed into _de novo_ assemblers, increasing the availability of reads for more accurate _de novo_ virus genome assembly.
