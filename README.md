ZWA2 is a context-based trimming bioinformatics tool for virus genome RNA-seq read decontamination based on a given reference. The tool dissects chimera reads that arise during NGS, removing chimeric moieties with sequences from the user input reference. The clean output reads are then ready to be fed into _de novo_ assemblers, increasing the availability of reads for more accurate and more efficacious _de novo_ virus genome assembly.

Installation
---------------
ZWA2 program may be exetuced at Linux & MacOS systems, but firstly requires the installation of the following prerequisites in order to work properly.
