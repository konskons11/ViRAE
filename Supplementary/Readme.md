**Supplementary figure 1:** Flowchart of the comparative virome methodology analysis performed in this study.

**Supplementary figure 2:** Comparison of the total number of reads mapped on viral sequences, as calculated after the implementation of each method (RAW, BWA, SORTMERNA and ZWA2) separately on the examined RNA-seq samples and subsequent mapping of the treated RNA-seq data on the corresponding viral genes/genomes by BWA. The median values for this metric are displayed within the bar plots. The statistical analysis of the mean differences across the studied methods was performed by RM-ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison testing, and the output statistical significance of ZWA2 is indicated by (*** p-value < 0.001).

**Supplementary figure 3:** Comparison of the coverage of viral sequences, as calculated after the implementation of each method (RAW, BWA, SORTMERNA and ZWA2) separately on the examined RNA-seq samples and subsequent mapping of the treated RNA-seq data on the corresponding viral genes/genomes by BWA. The dotted lines connecting the colorful dots on the graph depict the fluctuations of the viral coverage rates for the same RNA-seq sample, treated separately by each method. A small subsection of the diagram (viral coverage rates between 95% and 100%) is zoomed in for representation purposes, clearly displaying the corresponding plotted data on the right side. The statistical analysis of the mean differences across the studied methods was performed by RM-ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison testing, and the output statistical significance of ZWA2 is indicated by (** p-value < 0.01 and *** p-value < 0.001).

**Supplementary figure 4:** Comparison of the mean depth of reads mapped on viral sequences, as calculated after the implementation of each method (RAW, BWA, SORTMERNA and ZWA2) separately on the examined RNA-seq samples and subsequent mapping of the treated RNA-seq data on the corresponding viral genes/genomes by BWA. The median values for this metric are displayed within the bar plots. The statistical analysis of the mean differences across the studied methods was performed by RM-ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison testing, and the output statistical significance of ZWA2 is indicated by (**** p-value < 0.0001).
